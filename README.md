Qine App: Multiple intents and communication between Activities. 
Clicking the "Forum" button in the "Main Menu" activity directs the user to the "forum_menu" activity which makes use of multiple intents. The "participate" button at the top middle of the "forum_menu" will open another activity that allows the user to write a post, pick a topic and send. This sent post is later displayed in the "forum_menu" activity.
